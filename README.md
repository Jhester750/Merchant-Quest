# WW1-Project (Merchant Quest)
A fun school project about U-Boats in World War 1.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS
There are noticeable visual glitches when running on Windows, though it should run fine on Mac OS
These glitches include minor to major stuttering or flickering of the images
A temporary fix is to click on applet and continue to CLONE THE PROGRAM until flickering slows down

I cannot get around to fixing this issue so please just use the temporary fix or run it on a device using Mac OS. I did not test linux.
